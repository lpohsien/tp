StudMap (SM) is a desktop app for managing your students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SM can get your student management
tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `studmap.jar` [Coming soon].

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your StudMap.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app
   contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will
   open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`list`** : Lists all students.

    * **`add`**`n/John Doe m/CS2103T s/E1234567` : <br> Adds a student
      named `John Doe` to the StudMap.

    * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.

    * **`clear`** : Deletes all students.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* :warning: Class names should only consist of alphanumerics, spaces, dashes and underscores! Using any other
character will lead to your class name being **rejected**
* Marking an existing class as either `present` or `absent` will **overwrite** the existing record

Examples:

* `mark 1 present c/T01` marks the 1st student as present for class `T01`
* `mark all absent c/T04` marks all students in the list as absent for class `T04`

### Unmark attendance of a student: `unmark`

(i.e. no error will be thrown)

Examples:

* `unmark 1 c/T01` removes the attendance record for class `T01` from the 1st student
* `unmark all c/T04` marks all students as absent for class `T04` from all students in the list

### Add tag to student: `tag`

You can tag the student(s) with one or more text labels. This can help you to better identify and keep track of them.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

  **:information_source: Note 1:** The tag should be short and limited to only alphabets and/or numbers (i.e. no spaces). <br>

  **:information_source: Note 2:** The tags are case-sensisitve. For example, `goodStudent` and `goodstudent` will
  be recognised as different labels.

  **:information_source: Note 3:** The tagging command is cumulative, that is, new tags are simply added to the student(s) and
  do not replace their previous tags. To remove tags from the student(s), see [untag](#remove-tag-from-student-untag) below. <br>

</div>

Format: `tag INDEX/ALL t/TAG [t/OTHER]`

- `INDEX`: You can specify the index of the student you want to add the tag to. Alternatively, you can use `ALL` to add the new tags to everyone in the currently display list.
- `TAG`: You can specify the label to be added to the student. At least one label should be specified when you use this command
- `OTHER`: You can also optional tags that you might also want to add to your students.

- `TAG`: You can specify the `TAG` to remove.There should be at least one label to be removed when you use this command. For the restrictions on the format of a `TAG`, see Note 1 for [Add tag to student](#add-tag-to-student-tag).
- `OTHER`: You can also include multiple tags to be removed from your student(s).


Examples:

* `untag 1 t/needMoreTime`
* `untag all t/needMoreTime t/late`


### Grade assignment for student: `grade`

You can change the grading status for the assignments using this command. If the record of the assignment does not yet exist for the specified student, a new entry for the assignment will be automatically created for the student. This can help you to better keep track of assignments that you have graded or received.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

  **:information_source: Note 1:** The name of assignments should contain only numbers and alphabets (all upper case). If you include any lower case in the assignment name, it will be automatically converted to upper case.

</div>

Format: `grade INDEX/ALL STATUS a/ASSIGNMENT`

- `INDEX`: You can specify the index of the student you want to change the assignment grading status for. Alternatively, you can use `ALL` to modify the assignment grading status for every students in the currently displayed list.

  - `new`: The assignment has just been assigned to the student and hence it has not been submitted nor marked yet.
  - `received`: You have received the assignment submission from the student but you have not graded it yet.
  - `marked`: You have received and graded the assignment.
- `ASSIGNEMNT`: You can specify the assignment which you want to change the grading status for.
